# Project Plan

## Title
State-Wise Distribution of EV Charging Stations in USA

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. What states in the U.S. has the best infrastructure for Electric Vehicle?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Adoption of EV is extremely important for first world countries like U.S. and increase the dependence of industry on renewable energy resources. One of the fundamental parts of EV infrastructure is EV Charging Stations.

This study analyzes the EV Charging Stations available in different states of the U.S. and offers insights for organizations depicting the states and counties with the best EV infrastructure.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
